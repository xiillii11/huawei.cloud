            <li><b>Limited Global Presence:</b> Huawei Cloud has a relatively smaller global presence compared to other major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This can pose challenges for organizations with operations or customers in regions where Huawei Cloud has limited availability.</li>
            <li><b>Security Concerns:</b> Huawei, being a Chinese company, has faced scrutiny and security concerns from certain governments regarding potential data privacy and security risks. These concerns may make organizations hesitant to adopt Huawei Cloud, especially if they operate in industries with strict compliance and security.</li
